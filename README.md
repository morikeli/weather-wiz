# Weather website using django & Openweather API

This is a simple web-based weather app. The website uses OpenWeather API to fetch current weather of differrent cities and towns around the world.
The website will not work unless you have your own API_KEY to access OpenWeather API. I removed my API_KEY for security reasons.
To have your own API_KEY, create an account with OpenWeather -> https://openweathermap.org , once you have created an account, click the "API KEY" to generate personal API KEY.

Technologies used:
  - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
  - Django
  - OpenWeatherAPI
 
 Type in any known city name and press Enter or click the search button. The following details will be displayed:
  - City
  - country code
  - latitude & longitude
  - temperature
  - weather description 
  - wind speed
